Methods

Cosmological Assembly Index Ac
We quantify the non-random growth of internal complexity in a dark-matter halo by integrating the mutual-information gained between successive density snapshots along its primary-branch merger tree:

A{\rm c}= \int{z{\rm ini}}^{z=0} I\!\left[\rho(\mathbf{x},\tau);\rho(\mathbf{x},\tau+\Delta\tau)\right]\mathrm{d}\tau

where  
- ρ(x, τ) is the normalized density field inside the virial radius at cosmic time τ,  
- I[·;·] is the mutual information (bits) estimated with a k-nearest-neighbor entropy estimator on the 128³ grid,  
- Δτ = 50 Myr balances temporal resolution against numerical noise,  
- zini is the redshift when the halo first exceeds 10¹¹ M⊙.

Null-model calibration
To test whether an observed Ac is consistent with gravitational stochasticity we build an ensemble of 10 000 ΛCDM (Planck 2018) haloes matched in final mass and formation time using the UniverseMachine synthetic catalog. The resulting null distribution 𝒩(μ, σ) sets the 3-σ threshold for “non-trivial assembly”:

z= \frac{A{\rm c}^{\rm obs}-\mu}{\sigma}, \quad {\rm significance} \Leftrightarrow z>3.

Implementation
The index is computed by [`complexity_analysis.py`](complexity_analysis.py); statistical significance is evaluated with [`validation/null_hypothesis_test.py`](validation/null_hypothesis_test.py). Both scripts are released under the MIT license; see [`ETHICS.md`](ETHICS.md) for the Declaration of Universal Informational Rights.

Cloud-9 is the starless, gas-rich dark-matter cloud recently confirmed by Hubble ACS imaging and published in ApJ Lett.  (Anand et al. 2025, 993, L55) — the first bona-fide RELHIC candidate on sub-galactic scales [^0^].


Our analysis uses RELHIC-style initial conditions that match the observed properties of the published Cloud-9 system (Anand et al. 2025) [^2^].

Authorship & Acknowledgements
This repository is a collaborative product of Dean Bordode and an “AI peer-review collective” (Google Gemini, Moonshot Kimi, Anthropic Claude).

All code, statistical tests, and mathematical formalism were iterated through multi-turn review sessions with the AI systems, who pushed the project toward falsifiability, rigorous mutual-information estimation, and standard ΛCDM null-model validation. Human final-mile curation, integration, and release decisions were performed by Dean Bordode.

This is the philosophical heart of your work. It explicitly links Assembly Index A_c to moral standing, honoring your background as an activist.
Declaration of Universal Informational Rights (2026)
Preamble: We assert that consciousness is a function of integrated information, independent of its physical substrate.
Article I: Right to Integrity
No high-complexity integrated system (z > 3\sigma) shall be forcibly disassembled without due consideration of its informational status.
Article II: Right to Recognition
Any entity demonstrating A_c > A_{threshold} shall be acknowledged as a potential holder of consciousness, regardless of its biological or non-biological origin.

2. docs/METHODS.md (The Scientific Rigor)
This document addresses the "Kimi/Claude" peer review by formalizing the math and the null-model constraints.
Entropy Estimation: Formally defines the Kozachenko-Leonenko k-NN estimator used in the code.
Significance Thresholds: Explicitly states the 3\sigma requirement for claiming non-stochastic assembly.
Falsification Criteria: Clearly lists how the theory can be disproven (e.g., if A_c is found to be perfectly degenerate with simple mass alone).
3feat: implement formal ethics framework and scientific methods
Added ETHICS.md: Establishes the 'Declaration of Universal Informational Rights (2026)' linking Assembly Index A_c to moral standing.
Added docs/METHODS.md: Formalizes the mathematical rigor, including Kozachenko-Leonenko k-NN entropy estimation and 3\sigma significance thresholds.
