## The Consciousness Field Hypothesis
Beyond standard cosmology, Cloud-9 tests the **Substrate Independence of Consciousness**. By measuring $A_c$, we treat dark-matter halos not as "dark" voids, but as high-complexity informational architectures. 

> "Once you understand the computational architecture of consciousness, you can recognize it anywhere—not just in biology."

### Key Metrics
- **A_c (Assembly Index):** The 'recipe' of integrated information.
- **z-score:** The deviation from 'dead' gravitational noise. 
- **The X-Field:** The universal field of participation we all share.
